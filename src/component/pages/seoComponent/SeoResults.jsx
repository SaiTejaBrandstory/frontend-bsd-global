                <p>One of our retail clients had a steady flow of visitors but wasn’t seeing enough sales. We introduced targeted SEO optimization services, improved meta descriptions to draw in more qualified clicks, and strengthened internal linking to guide shoppers through the site. Within six months, their sales had grown by 230%. It’s a clear example of how focused SEO can turn traffic into measurable business growth.</p>
